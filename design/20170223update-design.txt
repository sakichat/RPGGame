logic:
character
+   level
    =   choose
+   ability scores  [W]
    =   4d6 creation
    +   Strength
    +   Dexterity
    +   Constitution
    +   Intelligence
    +   Wisdom
    +   Charisma

+   ability modifiers
    =   (ability/2) - 5 [round result down]
    The modifier is the number you add to or subtract from the die roll
    when your character tries to do something related to that ability.

+   hit points
    =   hit die + con mod
    Each roll of a Hit Die (from classes, d10 for fighter)
    (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1—that is,
    a character always gains at least 1 hit point
    each time he or she advances in level).

    Level 1 d10 = 8
    level 2 d10 = 2, con -5 = 9

+   armor class [W]
    =   dexterity modifer | worn armor
    =   10 + armor.ac + shield.ac + Dexterity modifier

+   attack bonus [W]
    =   level | strength modi | dexterity modi,
    A character’s attack bonus with a melee weapon is:
    Base attack bonus + Strength modifier +/ size modifier

+   damage bonus [W]
    =   strength modi of melee weapon (Ref > Combat > Strength Bonus)

Attack
    When a character makes an attack roll,
    he or she rolls 1d20 and adds his or her attack bonus.
    If the result equals or beats the target’s Defense, the character hits and deals damage

    A character’s Defense is equal to:
    10 + Dexterity modifier +/ class bonus + equipment bonus + size modifier
